Population prediction and multihazard exposure assessment

This repository was created for my Master Thesis with the title 'Anticipating a Risky Future: Neural Networks for Predictive Exposure Analysis.

Multiple Long Short-Term Memory deep learning networks are trained with multitemporal WorldPop population grids and ancillary geospatial data.

The resulting forecasted future population distributions are used together with an earthquake and tsunami model to quantify the affected population.
